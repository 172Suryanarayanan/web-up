<h1> Nithik Subhan V

</h1>
<p>👶 1. "Hi! I’m Nithik Subhan – Professional Milk Critic!"
Hello, world! Or should I say, hellooo ceiling fan! I’m Nithik Suban, born on 26th April 2024 — yes, I’m the new kid on the block, literally. I may be tiny, but I already run this house. I specialize in milk temperature checks, sudden scream tests, and midnight wake-up alarms. People say babies cry for no reason… Excuse me, I have many reasons: my toy blinked at me weirdly, my left sock feels suspicious, and someone dared to stop bouncing me! Honestly, these grown-ups need constant supervision.<br><br>
<br>
<br>


🍼 2. "My Daily Schedule? It’s a Full-Time Job!"
Let me walk you through my jam-packed day:
Wake up, cry a little to stretch the lungs. Then it’s breakfast time (milk again—chef’s special), followed by an intense session of staring at the ceiling, giggling at invisible things, and pooping like a champion. I take several power naps throughout the day — strategically timed to confuse my parents. I also hold regular meetings with my toes and spend 20 minutes daily trying to eat my own hand (it smells like adventure). Bath time is drama time. I'm not crying — I’m singing the song of my people!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


🧸 3. "They Think They’re in Charge… But I Know the Truth"
Let me tell you a secret — grown-ups are so easy to control. I just make a tiny “ehh” sound and boom — someone runs to pick me up. I sneeze and the whole family claps like I performed at a concert. I drop a toy and someone magically gives it back… it’s like telekinesis. I'm currently training to say “Da-da” just to see my dad cry happy tears (he thinks it’s about him — cute!). My life mission? To keep them all on their toes and steal hearts while drooling on their shoulders. Being Nithik Suban is a big responsibility — but hey, someone’s gotta do it!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

👑 4. "I Am Small... But I Rule This Kingdom!"
People say I’m a baby, but I prefer the term Tiny King. My throne? Anyone’s lap. My royal robe? A blanket with teddy bears on it. And my crown? Well... sometimes a diaper on my head (don’t judge — fashion is evolving). Everyone in my court jumps at my commands: “wah!” means feed me, “eh!” means pick me up, and “aaagoooh” means I'm just vibing. I’ve trained my entire family to dance like clowns just to make me smile. Honestly, if being cute was a superpower, I’d be the final boss.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


🎤 5. "Conversations with the Mirror"
Listen, I don’t like to brag, but the baby in the mirror? Wow. What a handsome fellow. I spend hours talking to him. I wave, he waves. I laugh, he laughs. It's a deep connection. Sometimes I even try to kiss him, but he’s shy and smashes his face back at mine. Suspicious. One day, I’ll figure out who this mysterious twin is. For now, we just make funny faces at each other and argue silently about who has the cuter cheeks (spoiler: it’s me).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


🤹‍♂️ 6. "I Invented a New Olympic Sport: Blanket Wrestling"
Forget cricket, football, or kabaddi. My game? Wrestling with my blanket at 3 AM. It’s intense. The blanket tries to cover me, I kick it off. It comes back, I scream. I win most nights. The crowd (aka my sleepy parents) cheer from the sidelines with messy hair and one eye open. Sometimes I surprise-attack my own foot thinking it’s an enemy. Fierce battles are fought in my crib. Victory is mine — until nap time knocks me out cold.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


🍌 7. "Why Does Everyone Keep Stealing My Cheeks?"
Every time someone sees me, they make that weird “awww” face and squish my cheeks. I’ve filed multiple complaints, but no one listens. I’m considering wearing a "Do Not Pinch" sign. My cheeks are not public property, people! I’ve been kissed more times in one month than most actors in an entire career. I'm like a soft toy with a heartbeat. I try to hide — under blankets, behind pillows, even inside my dad’s shirt — but nope. The cheek-attackers always find me.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


💩 8. "Yes, I Poop Like a Rockstar"
Let’s talk about the most powerful weapon in my arsenal — the Poop Bomb. Just when everything is calm and happy… BOOM. My face changes, my parents freeze, and a foul silence takes over the room. Then comes the great diaper race: who will clean it? They argue like it’s a game show. “Your turn!” “No, you do it!” Meanwhile, I just lie there like a smug little emperor. I’ve created more drama with one diaper than an entire soap opera season. Talent? I was born with it.
