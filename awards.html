<h1> Nithik Subhan V

</h1>
<p>🎉 1. "Welcome to the Grand Nithik Awards 2025!"
Hellooo everyone! I’m your host, guest of honor, cake smasher, and the birthday boy — Nithik Suban! claps for self with chubby hands I just turned ONE year old, and I must say... what a year of drooling success it has been! On my big day, everyone came dressed like it was the Oscars, but let’s be real — I was the star. I didn’t just receive gifts... oh no no, I received AWARDS. Fancy ones! For example, that big red car? “Best Vehicle for Reverse Crawling.” The squeaky duck toy? “Lifetime Achievement in Bathtub Entertainment.” And the soft teddy bear? “Best Emotional Support Buddy (Even at 3AM).”<br><br>

🏆 2. "Opening Gifts Like a True Celebrity"
Picture this: dramatic music, balloons flying, cake on my eyebrow… and me, ripping gift wrappers like a baby tornado. Every time I opened a gift, I gave an Oscar-worthy reaction: GASP! gibberish! toothless smile! Someone gave me socks shaped like animals — boom, “Best Costume Design.” A musical keyboard? “Most Likely to Annoy Parents Daily.” One aunt gifted me 5 sets of clothes — I call that the “Best Fashion Collection Award,” even though I plan to wear only the monkey-printed ones. And diapers — oh yes, so many diapers. I accept the “Best Safety Net Award,” because hey… accidents happen. A lot.<br><br>

🍰 3. "My Final Thank You Speech (with Cake in My Mouth)"
As I sat on my throne (high chair), eating cake with both hands and one foot, I looked at all my awards — sorry, gifts — and thought, “Wow. I didn’t walk yet, but I’ve already arrived.” I’d like to thank my fans (a.k.a. grandparents), my sponsors (mom and dad), and my emotional support team (that one balloon I stared at for an hour). This birthday was not just a party… it was my first red carpet moment. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have a diaper to fill and a toy drum to bang until someone gives me more cake. Nithik Suban — signing off with sugar on my face and sparkle in my soul!<br><br>

<h1> Me & My MOM

</h1>
<p>🍼 “My First Ever Award... She Cries When I Cry!”
Hi everyone! I’m Nithik Suban — CEO of Drooling and Managing Director of Diaper Explosions. But today I want to talk about my first and most important award ever — my Amma. Yes, before teddy bears, toys, and birthday cakes… she was my prize! She feeds me before she feeds herself, carries me like a sack of potatoes (but lovingly), and sings songs that don’t even have real words — just “laa laa baboooo baa.” She gets emotional over my burps and claps when I sneeze like I just won gold. Basically, I cry — she cries. I poop — she panics. I smile — she melts. Now that’s an award-winning performance.
<br>
<br>
❤️ “She Is Not Just My Mom… She’s My World”
People give me gifts, but Amma is the gift. She was there even before I knew what “there” means. She understands my silence, answers my cries, and makes every boring second magical. She’s my comfort, my safe place, and the softest pillow in the world. I may not have words yet, but if I did, I’d say this — My first award didn’t come wrapped in a box… she came wrapped in love. And trust me, no toy in the world will ever beat that.</p>
