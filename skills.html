    You think acting is hard? Try being a baby actor! I’ve been performing since day one — I cried on cue the moment I came out, no script needed. Every day is a new role: one minute I’m the innocent angel smiling at grandma, next minute I’m a dramatic soap opera star wailing because my toy giraffe fell over. I’ve nailed the “sleeping peacefully” scene at least three times today (Oscar-worthy, if you ask me), and don’t even get me started on my signature “I-didn’t-poop” face — total method acting. Directors? Please. I direct myself. I take snack breaks when I want, scream “cut!” with real tears, and improvise all my lines (mostly goo-goo and the occasional “uh-oh”). Honestly, adults have it easy. They get makeup and scripts. I get drool and a diaper. But hey, the show must go on — right after my nap.

  >You call that dancing? Please. I was shaking my diaper before I could even crawl. My dance career began the day I discovered my toes — instant choreography! When music comes on, it's like my tiny body goes full freestyle mode: arms flapping, legs kicking, and a head bob that looks like I’m dodging invisible mosquitoes. I don’t follow the beat — the beat follows me. Sometimes I dance just because someone opens the fridge. My go-to move? The "wobbly jelly jump," followed by the "accidental butt drop." And don’t be fooled — that fall was intentional. It’s called interpretive dance, grown-ups. Honestly, TikTok should be paying me for my moves. I’ve got the charm, the giggles, and a killer baby spin that ends in a burp. I may be small, but on the dance floor (aka living room rug), I’m a whole vibe. Now turn the music up and hand me a cookie — I perform best with snacks.

   You think fashion transitions are glamorous? Try switching outfits five times a day because of milk accidents, drool explosions, and what I like to call "mystery stains." I’m basically a runway model trapped in a diaper. Morning look? Onesie chic. Mid-morning? Pajama revival (because someone spilled mashed bananas on the first outfit). By noon, I’m rocking “half-dressed chaos” — pants somewhere around one ankle and a bib worn like a superhero cape. And don't even get me started on hats. Every time they put one on me, I throw it off with dramatic flair. That’s my signature move. My parents call it chaos, I call it a wardrobe evolution. I’m not just changing clothes — I’m making statements. Diaper to dungarees? That’s a look. Pajamas with socks on my hands? Iconic. They say babies grow fast — yeah, and so does our fashion. One minute I’m in teddy bear prints, next I’m serving full-on animal kingdom realness with giraffes, ducks, and dinosaurs battling for attention. And don’t even blink — I might transition into “naked protest mode” if the new outfit has too many buttons. Fashion week? Please. Every day is fashion week when you live in a world where spit-up is an accessory and every outfit ends up in the laundry. I'm the trendsetter this world didn’t know it needed — tiny, sassy, and dressed to drool.
